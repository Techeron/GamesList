## Introduction

This repository serves as a centralized location to document and manage the games I've played. It uses GitHub Projects to organize the games, track progress, and add notes for each game.

## How to Use

1. **Explore Games**: You can check out the [Projects Repository](https://github.com/orgs/Techeron/projects/1/views/1) to see the list of games I've played or currently playing. Each card represents a game.

2. **Game Details**: Click on a specific game project to view its details. You can find any notes or comments I've added.

4. **Contributing**: If you'd like to suggest a game for me to play or make improvements to the tracker, please let me know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YBbs3YBFCc)
